    An Excellent Host image hosting is a project built by a novice programmer to prove
    that they can construct and deploy a website. This site is actually not intended to
    host many images. Data is very finite. There is no money being made on this website.
    <br/><br/>
    None of the art hosted or posted here was sourced with permission. Nothing is original.
    If you would like your content taken down, send me an email at the address below. It is not checked often, however.
    <br/><br/>
    Please don't try to break the site unless you're actually thinking about hiring me.
    If you are, go ahead and break it as much as you like. I have backups. Kindly let me know.
    <br/><br/>
    You can contact me at HostExcellent@gmail.com
