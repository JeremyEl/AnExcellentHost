Included in here technical specifications and a description of the website

AnExcellentHost.com is an image hosting website. 
The primary use is to post an item for retrieval later (either to be linked to where a 
    direct upload is difficult) or as a form of external storage.
    
    Technical Specifications:
    I'm not sure what to write here. This should work on any modern browser and/or appliance.
    Uses HTML as the base, with some CSS to make it look pretty, and a little JS for added functionality.



CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY
Home Page:
    Images are random, but non-exclusive. Only one image (the duck) is not random and that is because it is a 
    preliminary measure to demonstrate and also work on the link-to-single-image page functionality.
    In a future build, all images will link to their own pages, and all images will be exclusively random.
Login:
    Username and Password fields are finished, but as there is no database yet, cannot take information.
    Likewise, LOGIN button doesn't work. Forgot Password has a placeholder message when clicked.
    Create Account takes the user to a Create Account Page.
Create Account:
    Has mostly working forms to submit information with. JS to verify passwords has so far failed.
    Otherwise, all that need be done is connect to a database so that the information actually
    goes somewhere. Also, need to add the Password Recovery function.
Image1:
    This is so far solely for EnlistedDuck.jpg. This is the preliminary page that will lay the 
    groundwork for all other image pages. Tags for the image are on the left. Work on comments
    was cut to make deadline. Images will be in a much larger, but not full scale here.
    The purpose of the buttons next to the tags is to up/downvote those tags as a community-guided
    moderation of the tags. + means it's accurate, - is not. Enough - and it will (soon) auto-delete.
Header:
    Full and realized across every page. Links to Home and Login currently work, others do not.
    Clicking on the logo also takes the user back to home.


    The front page should provide a random (exclusive) collection of items that are posted to the site.
    Each item should also have a link to its own page where it can be seen in full.
Each item on the website should have its own page which contains a list of tags created to further
    describe and/or categorize the image as well as a section of comments where users can share their 
    thoughts on the image with each other. These comments should have full reaction functionality.
    Finally, there will be a "Share" button that would prompt the user to share the image with a person
    or people on their friends list.
In addition, it is possible to create an account on the website which would enable a user to see all
    the items they've ever posted, as well as see a list of friends they've made on the site.
    From there, they can see their friend's profiles, as well as every image they've ever posted.
